I started using [xmonad](http://xmonad.org) a few months ago. I'm trying
to do my best to never use a mouse. I'm also very into automating things.
Shortly after I started using it, I noticed that whenever I needed to
pause [Pandora](http://pandora.com), I needed to switch to Chrome, switch
to the correct tab, and pause the player. I figured there's probably a
better way to do this. In comes
[pianobar](http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/).

Pianobar is a command-line Pandora player.
