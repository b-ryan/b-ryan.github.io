Summary: Ways to directly modify the contents of Vim registers.

Recently I came across PHP code that looked similar to this:

    #!php
    const YEAR = 1;
    const QUARTER = 2;
    const MONTH = 3;
    const WEEK = 4;
    const DAY = 5;
    const HOUR = 6;
    const SECOND = 7;

I wanted to write a switch statement which handled each of those constants.
This is what each case statement would look like:

    #!php
    case self::YEAR:
    case self::QUARTER:
    case self::MONTH:
    case self::WEEK:
    case self::DAY:
    case self::HOUR:
    case self::SECOND:

One way to achieve this would be to yank the whole text, paste it where the
switch will live, and with the help of a macro, change each line into a case
statement. [This article](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/advanced-vim-macros/) is
a great reference for advanced macro techniques, any of which would be useful
if we took this approach. However, it's possible to be more succinct by
building up the case statements incrementally with the help of registers
([:help
registers](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#registers)). This
post will show a few ways to do that so that you can learn how to master
registers. Here are some examples to start us off:

Command                         | Explanation
------------------------------- | -----------
`:let @a = ""`                  | *Clear out register "a"*
`:let @a .= "I am register a!"` | *Append the string "I am register a!" to register "a"*
`:let @c = "b is: " . @b`       | *Set register "c" to be the string "b is: " concatenated with register "b"*
`:reg c`                        | *Check what's in register "c"*
`"dyy`                          | *Replace register "d" with the current line*
`"Dyy`                          | *If you'd rather not overwrite register "d", but instead append to it*

*For more details on the `:let @` command, check out [:help
:let-@](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/eval.html#:let-@).*

Knowing just the above will get us far. Let's see how we can apply them toward
making our case statements. Our first exercise is pretty simple. We will get
the contents of register `a` to be:

    #!php
    YEAR
    QUARTER
    MONTH
    WEEK
    DAY
    HOUR
    SECOND

*(note that there will actually be an empty first line)*

Start by moving your cursor to the word "YEAR" and initializing register `a` to
a newline:

    #!vim
    /YEAR<CR>
    :let @a = "\n"<CR>

Doing so will make register `a` linewise ([:help
linewise](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#linewise)). I
explain below why this happens and what effect is has, but for now, suffice it
to say that when you yank more text into `a`, Vim will keep a newline at the
end of the register. Go ahead and yank the word "YEAR" onto the end of register
a to see it happen:

    #!vim
    "Aye

As we saw above, `"A` tells vim that the next thing we yank should be appended
to register `a` and `ye` means to yank until the end of the word. Examine
register `a` with `:reg a` to see it is set to`^JYEAR^J` (`^J` stands for the
newline character). Move your cursor down so it is on `QUARTER` and again use
`"Aye` to append onto `a`. `a` is now `^JYEAR^JQUARTER^J`. Do this for every
line (or even better, record a macro to automate it) and register `a` will have
the text we were going for.

That was a fun exercise, but to finish writing each case statement, we would
need to edit each line in register `a`, which we wanted to avoid in the first
place. We can do better. As before, move your cursor to `YEAR`, but this time
clear out register `a` entirely:

    #!vim
    /YEAR<CR>
    :let @a = ""<CR>

We will use another register to help us. Yank `YEAR` into register `b` and use
it to append to register `a`:

    #!vim
    "bye
    :let @a .= "case self::" . @b . ":\n"<CR>

This concatenates the text `case self::` with the contents of register `b` and
the string `:\n`. Register `a` is not linewise this time, so we have to append
the newline ourselves. `a` will now be `case self::YEAR:^J`. If we repeat the
above for each line (once again - use a macro!), register `a` will be:

    #!php
    case self::YEAR:
    case self::QUARTER:
    case self::MONTH:
    case self::WEEK:
    case self::DAY:
    case self::HOUR:
    case self::SECOND:

This is perfect. We eliminated the need to do any work after we pasted the
results. Instead, we just incrementally built the desired text within register
`a`.

We can make one further improvement. Using register `b` was an interesting way
of showing how you can use different registers and concatenate them together to
make the finished product. It's unnecessary, however, since we can use
`<C-R><C-W>` ([:help
<c\_CTRL-R\_CTRL-W\>](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/cmdline.html#c_CTRL-R_CTRL-W))
to insert the word under the cursor each time we append to `a`. To demonstrate
this, again move to the beginning of `YEAR` and clear register `a`. This time,
skip yanking to register `b` and do:

    #!vim
    :let @a .= "case self::<C-R><C-W>:\n"<CR>

After doing this for each line, register `a` will be the same as before.

Linewise vs. characterwise registers
====================================

As I mentioned above, Vim will make a register `linewise` when the expression
you assign using `:let @...` ends in a newline. Vim will keep a newline at the
end of the register whenever you append to it by yanking, deleting, etc., but
not when you directly modify the register using `:let @...`. Even if you
already have something in the register and append using `:let @a .= ...`, the
register will change to linewise.

If you want to get around this, you have a few options. The first uses yanking
to get a newline at the end of your register. In insert mode, type
`<C-V><C-M>`. This inserts a newline character which you can yank into register
`a` with `"ayl`. Register `a` will still be `characterwise`, but `a` will have
a trailing newline character.

A second option, which is perhaps a bit hackier, is to not append just a
newline to your register, but a newline plus some other character. For example:

    #!vim
    :let @a = "\n|"<CR>

Here the register ends with the pipe character. You could use a space or tab or
any non-newline character. In our PHP example from the previous section, this
technique might have been useful if we wanted each line to begin with a tab
character, for example.
