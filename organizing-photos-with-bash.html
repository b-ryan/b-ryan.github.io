    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I've been trying to organize my photos recently. I hadn't kept up with them
and I recently discovered I have a pile of photos dumped into a single
directory. I like to separate photos by the day they were taken so I end up
with directories like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>2015-01-01_new-years-day
2014-12-31_new-years-eve
2014-12-25_christmas
...
</pre></div>


<p>Wanting to organize these as painlessly as I could think, I sought to run a few
bash commands to split my pile of photos into directories like these. The first
issue I ran into was the file formats - these were raw photos. I had found a
nice tool called <code>exif</code> (<code>sudo apt-get install exif</code>) which I could use to
extract the date the pictures were taken, but it only works on JPG images.</p>
<p>So step one was to convert the files. The
<a href="http://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> tool (<code>sudo apt-get install
imagemagick</code>) has a command called <code>convert</code> that will do just that. To convert
them all without risking overwriting anything, a simple for loop works nicely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> f in *.NEF<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    convert <span class="nv">$f</span> <span class="nv">$f</span>.jpg
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will convert files like <code>DSC_0001.NEF</code> to <code>DSC_0001.NEF.jpg</code>. Running this
command was taking awhile and I wanted to see how much work was left to do.
<code>watch</code> is the perfect tool for the job. It lets you repeatedly run a command
and see its output. So all I needed to do was write a command that would list
all of the <code>.NEF</code> files that did not have corresponding <code>.NEF.jpg</code> files.  To
do that, I used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> f in *.NEF<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    ls <span class="nv">$f</span>.jpg <span class="p">&amp;</span>&gt;/dev/null <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$f</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I ignored all output of <code>ls</code> (<code>&amp;&gt;/dev/null</code>) because the return code would be
enough to determine whether the file existed. More importantly, I didn't want
to have to parse through whatever output the command threw at me. The <code>|| echo
$f</code> will only be executed if the <code>ls</code> failed, indicating the file doesn't
exist.</p>
<p>I had issues running this directly with <code>watch</code>, but I didn't want to spend
time debugging. Instead I saved the command to a file and ran:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chmod +x script.sh
watch ./script.sh
</pre></div>


<p>Every 2 seconds the screen updated letting me know how many files were left
to convert.</p>
<p>While the conversion was running, I prepared to get exif data out of the jpg
files. I mentioned above that <code>exif</code> will do just that. Here's what a sample
run looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  $ exif DSC_0093.JPG

<p>(This was a <em>really</em> old photo - most of them were much more recent.)</p>
<p>I noticed there was the <code>Date and Time</code> tag in there. And in reading the man
page for <code>exif</code>, saw that I could ask for values of specific tags using the
<code>--tag</code> argument. Here is what happened for the same file above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  $ exif --tag &#39;Date and Time&#39; DSC_0093.JPG 
EXIF entry &#39;Date and Time&#39; (0x132, &#39;DateTime&#39;) exists in IFD &#39;0&#39;:
Tag: 0x132 (&#39;DateTime&#39;)
  Format: 2 (&#39;ASCII&#39;)
  Components: 20
  Size: 20
  Value: 2007:04:09 16:15:47
</pre></div>


<p>We can work with that! A few <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code> commands later and I had:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  $ exif --tag &#39;Date and Time&#39; DSC_0093.JPG \
    | grep Value \
    | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; \
    | awk -F&#39;:&#39; &#39;{print $1 &quot;-&quot; $2 &quot;-&quot; $3}&#39;
2007-04-09
</pre></div>


<p>To break that down: <code>grep Value</code> is pretty obvious. It will leave only the
line containing <code>Value</code> so now our result will look like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  Value: 2007:04:09 16:15:47
</pre></div>


<p>Then this gets piped to <code>awk '{print $2}'</code>. This is a very common type of awk
command to run. Since awk splits on whitespace by default, this will get us
the second column, which in this case contains the text</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">2007</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">04</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">09</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I didn't care about the time of the photo since I'm planning to lump all of
the photos from the same day into a given directory. If I had wanted the date
<em>and</em> time, I could have used <code>awk '{print $2 " " $3}'</code>.</p>
<p>Now that I have the date, I want it in my preferred format of <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> so
I once again turned to awk. This time I used <code>-F':'</code> to specify that I wanted
to split on <code>:</code> instead of whitespace. Then I rest of the command glues the
date, month, and year parts together with <code>-</code> in between.</p>
<p>So now I have to use all of this to make the directories and dump files into
them. Before actually creating any directories or moving any files, however,
I wanted to sanity check everything. I wrote a loop that spit out each of the
<code>*NEF.jpg</code> files and the date I calculated for them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> f in *NEF.jpg<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> -n <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$f</span><span class="s2"> &quot;</span>
    <span class="nv">dt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>exif --tag <span class="s1">&#39;Date and Time&#39;</span> <span class="nv">$f</span> <span class="se">\</span>
            <span class="p">|</span> grep Value <span class="se">\</span>
            <span class="p">|</span> awk <span class="s1">&#39;{print $2}&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
            <span class="p">|</span> awk -F<span class="s1">&#39;:&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;{print $1 &quot;-&quot; $2 &quot;-&quot; $3}&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$dt</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>-n</code> flag to <code>echo</code> tells it to not print a newline. I then saved the
result of the command to calculate the picture's date to a variable called
<code>dt</code> so that I could reuse it in the code to follow. Here's a snippet of the
results:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DSC_1455.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1456.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1457.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1458.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1460.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1461.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1463.NEF.jpg    2014-07-28
DSC_1506.NEF.jpg    2014-09-03
DSC_1507.NEF.jpg    2014-09-03
DSC_1512.NEF.jpg    2014-09-03
</pre></div>


<p>After sanity checking the results, I felt confident enough to go forward. Here
is the final product:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> f in *NEF.jpg<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nv">dt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>exif --tag <span class="s1">&#39;Date and Time&#39;</span> <span class="nv">$f</span> <span class="se">\</span>
            <span class="p">|</span> grep Value <span class="se">\</span>
            <span class="p">|</span> awk <span class="s1">&#39;{print $2}&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
            <span class="p">|</span> awk -F<span class="s1">&#39;:&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;{print $1 &quot;-&quot; $2 &quot;-&quot; $3}&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>

    mkdir <span class="nv">$dt</span> <span class="p">&amp;</span>&gt;/dev/null
    mv <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">f</span><span class="p">%.jpg</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="nv">$dt</span>/
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The most interesting part of this code is the <code>${f%.jpg}</code>. This chops <code>.jpg</code>
off of the end of the string. To fully grasp what's going on, check out <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html">this
article</a>, specifically
the section titled <strong>Substring Removal</strong>.</p>
<p>And that was it! Was a lot of faster than doing it by hand. Maybe there are
tools out there that could have done this for me, but I found this more fun.
You can really do some neat stuff with everyday command-line tools. I highly
recommend using them for tasks like this to become comfortable writing bash.</p>
